# Developer Technical Assignment - To-Do Application

Hello! This repository contains your technical assignment for evaluating your skills. Through this task, we aim to assess your proficiency with **React**, **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, **CSS**, and other relevant technologies.

### **Task Objective**
The goal of this task is to develop a **To-Do Application**. The application should allow users to add, mark as completed, and delete tasks.

### **Technology Stack**
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS or SASS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, RESTful API
- **Testing**: Jest

### **Task Requirements**
#### **1. Frontend Requirements**
- Display a **list of tasks** on the screen, showing each task's **completed/incomplete** status.
- Allow users to **add**, **delete**, and **toggle the status** (completed/incomplete) of tasks.
- Use **React** and **TypeScript** for building the frontend.
- Style the application using **TailwindCSS** or **SASS**.
- Write **unit tests** for the main components using **Jest**.

#### **2. Backend Requirements**
- Implement the backend using **Node.js** and **Express** to create a **RESTful API**.
- Provide the following API endpoints to manage tasks:
  - `GET /api/todos`: Retrieve the list of tasks
  - `POST /api/todos`: Add a new task
  - `PUT /api/todos/:id`: Update the task status (complete/incomplete)
  - `DELETE /api/todos/:id`: Delete a task
- Use a **simple in-memory database** (such as an array or object) to store tasks.

#### **3. Testing Requirements**
- **Frontend**: Write **unit tests** for major components using **Jest**.
- **Backend**: Write tests to ensure the basic functionality of the API (using Jest or other tools).
- **Test Example**:
  - Ensure that tasks can be added successfully
  - Test task status toggling
  - Test task deletion
